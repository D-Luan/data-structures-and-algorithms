## GeeksforGeeks Problems: Hashing

This directory contains my solutions to GeeksforGeeks problems that are effectively solved using hash tables (`Dictionary` in C#).

Each solution demonstrates a practical application of hashing concepts, such as frequency counting or finding complements, to achieve optimal performance.
