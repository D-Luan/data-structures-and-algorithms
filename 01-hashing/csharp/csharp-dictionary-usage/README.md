## C# Dictionary and Class-based Data Modeling

This C# console application demonstrates the practical use of the `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` class, including operations like insertion, searching, updating, and deletion.

A key feature of this example is the refactoring from a nested dictionary`(Dictionary<string, Dictionary<string, string>>)` to a more type-safe structure using the `AstronautInfo class`, which is considered good practice in object-oriented programming.
